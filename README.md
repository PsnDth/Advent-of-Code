# Advent of Code Solutions
This isn't all the solutions, but only for the questions that I found difficult enough to save the code file onto my old laptop. Also it is usually only the second part of the question that is featured since it usually required modifications and/or improvements to the first part. 
## Note about Clarity
Since my coding team for this challenge consisted of just myself, and I generally am pretty good at writing my code only one way, the comments are severely minimal usually explaining the algorithm if it took more than one sitting for me to come up with a working process
Sometimes I didn't even bother fixing the comment when I fixed the algorithm so check the code (I'll probably go through everything later prior to the next Advent, if there will be one this year)
## Final Note
THe fun about these challenges are coming up with the solutions any way that works, so instead of trying to understand my solutions cover to cover, try instead to apply my algorithm or what not to answering the questions. That's how I got all 50 stars, and it was so worth it to see that magical display.
